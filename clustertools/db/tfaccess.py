    Convenience function to quickly and easily load a dataset using best guess defaults.
    If a table is loaded, then the ``input_transformation`` argument is required.
    Returns an instance of ``FIFOQueueLoader`` that loads this dataset into a fifo queue.

    This function takes a single argument, which is either a tensorflow placeholder for the
    requested array or a dictionary of tensorflow placeholders for the columns in the
    requested table. The output of this function should be either a single tensorflow tensor,
    a tuple of tensorflow tensors, or a list of tensorflow tensors. A subsequent call to
    ``loader.dequeue()`` will return tensors in the same order as ``input_transform``.

    For example, if an array is stored in uint8 format, but we want to cast
    it to float32 format to do work on the GPU, the ``input_transform`` would be:

    ::

        def input_transform(ary_batch):
            return tf.cast(ary_batch, tf.float32)

    If, instead we were loading a table with column names ``label`` and ``data`` we
    need to transform this into a list. We might use something like the following
    to also do the one hot transform.

    ::

        def input_transform(tbl_batch):
            labels = tbl_batch['labels']
            data = tbl_batch['data']

            truth = tf.to_float(tf.one_hot(labels, num_labels, 1, 0))
            data_float = tf.to_float(data)

            return truth, data_float

    Then the subsequent call to ``loader.dequeue()`` returns these int the same order:

    ::

        truth_batch, data_batch = loader.dequeue()

    By default, this function does not preserve on-disk ordering, and gives cyclic access.
